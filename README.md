**Overview**

This app is created by Hasan Osman for the Capstone Project of Udacity's  [Front End Web Developer Nano Degree (FEND)](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011). The Capstone is a travel app which aims to consolidte the skills learrned in projects 1 - 4 of FEND. The travel app, at a minimum, requires the user to enter a desired trip location and his/her travel dates. In response, the app displays an image of the user's travel destination and a current 16-day weather forecast. If the user's trip starts later than 16 days from the date of them having entered their information, the app will display a message advising the user to return at a later date closer to his travel time to view the updated weather forecast.  
Beyond the requirements of the app displying an image of the user's destination along with the weather forecast, I have added a few extra functionalities. The app displays the duration of the trip and the number of days remaining before the start of the trip. Finally, if the user would like to know more facts about the country he/she is visiting he/she can select the country from a drop-down list and certain information such as language, population, currency etc will be displayed.
